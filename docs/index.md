# The Story
SpotMicro was originally developed by KDY and released on thingiverse here: [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3445283](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3445283). He has posted that he is required to join the military in his country for two years and so will be absent from development. Hopefully by the time he returns to the community we'll have a fully funcitonal bot that he can come back to.

# Current State
The rest of us are eager to get our hands on a reasonably priced quadruped and so have continued development in his absence. Development happens at the following locations:

- Codebase: [github.com/FlorianWilk/SpotMicroAI](https://github.com/FlorianWilk/SpotMicroAI)
- Documentation: [spotmicroai.readthedocs.io](https://spotmicroai.readthedocs.io)
- STL Files: [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3761340](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3761340)
- Dicussion: SLACK/DISCORD (Still needs to be setup)

# Contributing
This project is still very much in its infancy and so any contributions are very much appreciated. Key problems that still need to be addressed are: 

- Reasonable costing servos with sufficient strength
- Environment for reinforcement learning
- Documentation and First Build tutorial
